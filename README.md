PLANNING:

Using the following wireframes:  http://imgur.com/gallery/FuFipps

And the following user stories:
As a player, I want to be able to log in and play tic tac stories.
As a player, I want to be able to log in and find my current tick tac toe record.
As a player, I want to be able to play tic tac toe with a specific friend.
As a player, I want to be able to see an event when I win or lose a game.
As a player, I want to be able to challenge someone to a rematch after a game.

I was able to put together a Tic Tac Toe application using HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery and Ajax.

Ideally I would be able to go back and do some refactoring, as well as figure out how to make the forms look better when I have more of a handle on CSS.

Problem solving consisted of a lot of research through both closed tickets and on the wider internet.
